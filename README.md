URL-Shortener-Project
URL Shortener service usually takes a long URL and generates a unique short URL. When the user accesses that short URL it will be redirected to a long URL which is to be generated from the short URL. You need to implement a service that should have an API to generate a long URL to a short URL and also a UI where the user can submit a long URL and display a shortURL of that long URL.
